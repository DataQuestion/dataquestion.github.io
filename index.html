        Welcome to "<b>Data Question</b>"! This blog aims to document my personal journey into the world of data analysis. Here, you'll find my step-by-step progress as I dive into hands-on projects exploring real-world data. In every project, I start with a main question and the entire process revolves around answering that question. Along the way, additional questions naturally arise as I explore deeper, each one driving me closer to a conclusion. I am committed to sharing what I learn with you whenever I gain new knowledge.
