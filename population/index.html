            <h2>Question: What is a population?</h2>
            <p>
                Here, I delve into one of the most fundamental and fascinating data themes: "<b>population</b>". I've often wondered how population shifts influence everything from economic growth to social dynamics. As I begin my journey into data analysis, I'll be uncovering stories hidden within the numbers, hoping to offer insights into how populations change over time. While I am still learning, my goal is to discover meaningful connections between data and real-world trends. Join me as I explore how analyzing population dynamics might reveal powerful insights!

            <h3>How to define population?</h3>
            <p>
                The term <dfn>population</dfn> can be defined in various contexts, in statistics, ecology, social sciences etc. It can be vary in meaning across different fields, but it fundamentally represents a complete set of entities sharing common traits, whether they are people, animals, or other items of interest.
            </p>
            <p>    
                I am more interested in human population in social sciences context, particularly demography and population geography. Demography is the statistical study of populations, focusing on quantifiable aspects such as birth rates, death rates, age structure, and population growth. On the other hand, population geography focuses on the spatial aspects of population, meaning how populations are distributed across geographic regions and how they interact with the physical space they occupy.  
            </p>
            <h3>What is definition of population in demography?</h3>
            <p>
                Population, in demography, refers to a group of individuals, often in a defined region, whose characteristics and dynamics are statistically analyzed to understand trends and changes over time.

            <h3>What is definition of population in population geography?</h3>
            <p>
                Population, in population geography, refers to the study of the distribution, density, and movement of people across various locations. It examines how physical environments influence where and how populations settle.
