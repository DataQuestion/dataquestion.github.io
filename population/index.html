            Here, I delve into one of the most fundamental and fascinating data themes: "<b>population</b>". I've often wondered how population shifts influence everything from economic growth to social dynamics. As I begin my journey into data analysis, I'll be uncovering stories hidden within the numbers, hoping to offer insights into how populations change over time. While I am still learning, my goal is to discover meaningful connections between data and real-world trends. Join me as I explore how analyzing population dynamics might reveal powerful insights!

        <h3>What is the definition of population?</h3>
        <p>
            The term <dfn>population</dfn> means (1) all the inhabitants of a given country or area (province, city, metropolitan area etc.) considered together; the number of inhabitants of a country of area. (2) In sampling, the whole collection of units (persons, households, institutions, events etc.) from which a sample may be drawn.
