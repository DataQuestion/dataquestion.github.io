            <h2>Question: What is the Total Population of Each U.S. State?</h2>
            <p>
                This project focuses on answering a straightforward yet significant question: What is the total population of each U.S. state? Through data analysis, I hope to uncover patterns and insights into how populations are distributed across the U.S., offering a clearer picture of the country's demographic makeup. By examining data from reliable sources like the U.S. Census Bureau, I will build the foundation of this analysis, learning more about the process of collecting, cleaning, and visualizing data.
